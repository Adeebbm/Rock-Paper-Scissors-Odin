# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Odin
VERSION 1
This project is from the odin project for web development course.Its target is to make a rock paper scissors game that can be played purely in the console.
Its purpose is to to strengthen the ability to use javascript syntax and logic.
It usese functions, loops,string manipulation, math.random().... 

VERSION 2
After finishing the first version, I have now now added html and css to the project giving it a gui thus it no longer needs to be played in the console.
The additional skills needed were:
-knowledge in html and css
-Linking the html and css to the javascript
-the use of javascript tools such as event listeners and DOM manipulation methods
